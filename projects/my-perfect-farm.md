# My Perfect Farm: Farming Game
**Platform:** Android • **Role:** Gameplay/Systems/UI • **Engine:** Unity • **Language:** C#

## Overview
Casual farming sim focused on **clear production loops**: plant → harvest → craft/sell → expand. Animal care (camels, cows, chickens, etc.), area unlocks, and a light economy.

## Contributions
- **Scriptable, scalable animal behaviour system** (SO‑configured states) for feeding, wandering, production and interactions (cows/camels/chickens, etc.).
- **Data‑driven crops system** integrated with field/patch states (seed → water → harvest) with save/load to restore visuals and logic.
- **Helper AI** that **automates routine tasks** (harvesting, feeding, transporting) using priorities/area triggers to keep the farm running.
- **Milking flow** for dairy animals with timers, boosters and UI feedback; output routed to inventory/storage and economy sinks.
- **Customer loop**: spawning/queuing, orders and fulfilment, payouts and progression that tie production to the in‑game economy.
