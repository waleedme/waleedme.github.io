# My Perfect Farm: Farming Game
**Platform:** Android • **Role:** Gameplay/Systems/UI • **Engine:** Unity • **Language:** C#

## Overview
Casual farming sim focused on **clear production loops**: plant → harvest → craft/sell → expand. Animal care (camels, cows, chickens, etc.), area unlocks, and a light economy.

## Contributions
- **Modular crop & animal systems** using ScriptableObjects and interfaces; easy to add new content without core rewrite.
- **State machines** for growth/interaction; coroutine‑driven timing with save/load.
- **UI/UX** for tasks, inventory, and upgrades with readable states and progress.
- **Optimization** for low‑end devices (pooling, reduced GC spikes, simple LOD).

## Links
